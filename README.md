# Simple_Linear_Regession
Linear regression is a supervised learning method that finds the relationship between X and Y values that are 
real values(Continuous variables not discrete!).
# Evaluation
We evalute it using: R2 square : Above 90% is good.
                     Mean Squared Error: Near to 0 is better
                     Root mean Squared Error: Near to 0 is better
